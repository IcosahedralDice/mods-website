You can build the project by running main.py from src folder. This extracts all necessary files to parent folder of src. Building src recreates the whole codebase (except CNAME and README.md files), therefore you should only make your changes in src.

This project is based on [ipho-unofficial](https://github.com/abeakkas/ipho-unofficial.org).
